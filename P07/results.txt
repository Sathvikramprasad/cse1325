QUESTION 1: What Boggle command line arguments ([#boards] and if not default [boardSize])did you use to achieve a 30 to 45 second runtime? Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question.


Solution- 43 board, 100 boardsize and 1 thread

QUESTION 2: Provide the full output (including the time command) for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is the same for all 16 runs.** With bash, you can run all of these with a single command if you like, replacing "90" with whatever Boggle command line arguments you identified in QUESTION 1: 

for i in {1..16} ; do echo ; echo $i Threads; time java Boggle 90 - $i ; done

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

Soltution - It starts to speed up when i add initial few threads but eventually increases time because it overloads the system

QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

Solution - Yes, it causes System overload because when we add more number of threads it starts running parallelly.

QUESTION 5: Time your version of Boggle as you did for the full credit version. Is this additional layer of threading faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? Why?
